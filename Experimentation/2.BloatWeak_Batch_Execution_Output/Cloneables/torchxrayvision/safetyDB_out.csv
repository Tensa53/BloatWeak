For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.
