The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data.

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types. This commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and types. The Tensorflow team has patched the issue in GitHub commit ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1.
