1,lxml,~=4.8,/home/daniele/git/NICHE_projects/Repo/Cloneables/CMSIS_5/CMSIS/CoreValidation/Project/requirements.txt,False,CVE-2022-2309,<4.9.1,"Lxml 4.9.1 includes a fix for CVE-2022-2309: NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered."

The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the '_punctuation_re regex' operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation. This issue can be mitigated by Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing request timeouts and limiting process memory."
