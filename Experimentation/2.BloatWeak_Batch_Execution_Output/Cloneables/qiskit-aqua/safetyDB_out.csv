NOTE: The vendor does not agree this is a vulnerability. In (very limited) circumstances a user may be able provoke the buffer overflow, the user is most likely already privileged to at least provoke denial of service by exhausting memory. Triggering this further requires the use of uncommon API (complicated structured dtypes), which is very unlikely to be available to an unprivileged user.

Further, it should be practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place.

This vulnerability requires that the function 'IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title' be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on 'ctypes' in 'IPython.utils._process_win32' prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool 'set_term_title' could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. If an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. As a workaround, users should ensure that any calls to the 'IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title' function are done with trusted or filtered input.
