The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

As a result, attackers can trigger denial of service (via dereferencing 'nullptr's or via 'CHECK'-failures) as well as abuse undefined behavior (binding references to 'nullptr's). An attacker can also read and write from heap buffers, depending on the API that gets used and the arguments that are passed to the call. Given that the boosted trees implementation in TensorFlow is unmaintained, it is recommend to no longer use these APIs. TensorFlow's boosted trees APIs will be deprecated in subsequent releases.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data.

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

The issue is patched in commit 390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1."""

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the 'mktemp' function usage. It was replaced 'mktemp' with the safer 'mkstemp'/'mkdtemp' functions, according to the usage pattern.

This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data.

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

However, the validation uses 'OP_REQUIRES' which translates to setting the 'Status' object of the current 'OpKernelContext' to an error status, followed by an empty 'return' statement which just terminates the execution of the function it is present in. However, this does not mean that the kernel execution is finalized: instead, execution continues from the nQext line in 'Compute' that follows the call to 'ValidateInputs'. This is equivalent to lacking the validation. The Tensorflow team has patched the issue in GitHub commit 9728c60e136912a12d99ca56e106b7cce7af5986."

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

The 'axis' argument is translated into 'concat_dim' in the 'ConcatShapeHelper' helper function. Then, a value for 'min_rank' is computed based on 'concat_dim'. This is then used to validate that the 'values' tensor has at least the required rank. However, 'WithRankAtLeast' receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented. Due to the fact that 'min_rank' is a 32-bits value and the value of 'axis', the 'rank' argument is a negative value, so the error check is bypassed.

The implementation of the padded version (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the 'fixed_length' value to the size of the type argument.

The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the 'out_data' pointer by 'fixed_length * sizeof (T)' bytes whereas it only copied at most 'fixed_length' bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory."

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types.
