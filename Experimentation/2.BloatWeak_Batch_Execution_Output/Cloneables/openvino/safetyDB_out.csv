The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

However, there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays. In most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library."

Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data.

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types. This commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and types. The Tensorflow team has patched the issue in GitHub commit ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1.

This led to ASAN failures because the 'AllocatedBytes()' is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the '.data()' buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as 'tstring' include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1."

However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

An attacker can also read and write from heap buffers, depending on the API that gets used and the arguments that are passed to the call.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types. This commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and types. The Tensorflow team has patched the issue in GitHub commit ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

This is followed by reencoding code (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the 'out_data' pointer by 'fixed_length * sizeof (T)' bytes whereas it only copied at most 'fixed_length' bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory."

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types. This commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and types. The Tensorflow team has patched the issue in GitHub commit ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1.

Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

First, the code computes (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the 'fixed_length' value to the size of the type argument.

The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the 'out_data' pointer by 'fixed_length * sizeof (T)' bytes whereas it only copied at most 'fixed_length' bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory."

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types.

This occurs whenever 'axis' is a negative value less than '-1'. In this case, we are accessing data before the start of a heap buffer. The code allows 'axis' to be an optional argument ('s' would contain an 'error::NOT_FOUND' error code). Otherwise, it assumes that 'axis' is a valid index into the dimensions of the 'input' tensor. If 'axis' is less than '-1' then this results in a heap OOB read. The fix is included in TensorFlow 2.7.0.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

The 'axis' argument is translated into 'concat_dim' in the 'ConcatShapeHelper' helper function. Then, a value for 'min_rank' is computed based on 'concat_dim'. This is then used to validate that the 'values' tensor has at least the required rank. However, 'WithRankAtLeast' receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented. Due to the fact that 'min_rank' is a 32-bits value and the value of 'axis', the 'rank' argument is a negative value, so the error check is bypassed.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

It was replaced 'mktemp' with the safer 'mkstemp'/'mkdtemp' functions, according to the usage pattern.

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

First, the code computes (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the 'fixed_length' value to the size of the type argument.

The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the 'out_data' pointer by 'fixed_length * sizeof (T)' bytes whereas it only copied at most 'fixed_length' bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory."

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types. This commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and types. The Tensorflow team has patched the issue in GitHub commit ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1.

In version 2.8.0, the 'TensorKey' hash function used total estimated 'AllocatedBytes()', which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. 'int32_t'). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through 'tensor.data()' of size 'AllocatedBytes()'. This led to ASAN failures because the 'AllocatedBytes()' is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the '.data()' buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as 'tstring' include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1."

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.

This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.
