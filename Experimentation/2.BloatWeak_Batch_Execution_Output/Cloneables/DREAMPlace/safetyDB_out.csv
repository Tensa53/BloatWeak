2,numpy,>=1.15.4,/home/daniele/git/NICHE_projects/Repo/Cloneables/DREAMPlace/requirements.txt,False,CVE-2021-33430,<1.21.0rc1,"Numpy 1.21.0rc1 includes a fix for CVE-2021-33430: A Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the PyArray_NewFromDescr_int function of ctors.c when specifying arrays of large dimensions (over 32) from Python code, which could let a malicious user cause a Denial of Service. 
NOTE: The vendor does not agree this is a vulnerability. In (very limited) circumstances a user may be able provoke the buffer overflow, the user is most likely already privileged to at least provoke denial of service by exhausting memory. Triggering this further requires the use of uncommon API (complicated structured dtypes), which is very unlikely to be available to an unprivileged user.

NOTE: the vendor states that this reported code behavior is ""completely harmless.""

NOTE: The vendor does not agree this is a vulnerability; the negative dimensions can only be created by an already privileged user (or internally).

5,numpy,>=1.15.4,/home/daniele/git/NICHE_projects/Repo/Cloneables/DREAMPlace/requirements.txt,False,CVE-2021-41495,<1.22.2,"Numpy 1.22.2  includes a fix for CVE-2021-41495: Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability exists in numpy.sort in NumPy in the PyArray_DescrNew function due to missing return-value validation, which allows attackers to conduct DoS attacks by repetitively creating sort arrays. 
NOTE: While correct that validation is missing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place.
