This vulnerability requires that the function 'IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title' be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on 'ctypes' in 'IPython.utils._process_win32' prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool 'set_term_title' could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. If an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. As a workaround, users should ensure that any calls to the 'IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title' function are done with trusted or filtered input.
