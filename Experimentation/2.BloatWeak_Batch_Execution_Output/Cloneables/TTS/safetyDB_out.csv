When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5."

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until ""NewTensor"" returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types. This commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and types. The Tensorflow team has patched the issue in GitHub commit ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1.

In version 2.8.0, the 'TensorKey' hash function used total estimated 'AllocatedBytes()', which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. 'int32_t'). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through 'tensor.data()' of size 'AllocatedBytes()'. This led to ASAN failures because the 'AllocatedBytes()' is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the '.data()' buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as 'tstring' include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves.

When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5."

587,tensorflow,==2.3.1,/home/daniele/git/NICHE_projects/Repo/Cloneables/TTS/requirements_tests.txt,False,CVE-2020-15211,"<1.15.4,>=2.0.0a0,<2.0.3,>=2.1.0a0,<2.1.2,>=2.2.0a0,<2.2.1,>=2.3.0a0,<2.3.1","Tensorflow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, and 2.3.1 include a fix for CVE-2020-15211: In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

These issues were discovered internally via tooling while working on improving/testing GPU op determinism. As such, there aren't reproducers and there will be multiple fixes for these issues.

In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as 'MutableHashTableShape') produce extra output information in the form of a 'ShapeAndType' struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. 'ShapeRefiner' is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but the Tensorflow team was not doing the same for shapes and types.

When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5."

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative ""-1"" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the ""-1"" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom ""Verifier"" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the ""-1"" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code."

The 'axis' argument is translated into 'concat_dim' in the 'ConcatShapeHelper' helper function. Then, a value for 'min_rank' is computed based on 'concat_dim'. This is then used to validate that the 'values' tensor has at least the required rank. However, 'WithRankAtLeast' receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented. Due to the fact that 'min_rank' is a 32-bits value and the value of 'axis', the 'rank' argument is a negative value, so the error check is bypassed.

This is equivalent to lacking the validation. The Tensorflow team has patched the issue in GitHub commit 9728c60e136912a12d99ca56e106b7cce7af5986."

In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, ""C.TF_TString_Dealloc"" is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions).

NOTE: The vendor does not agree this is a vulnerability; the negative dimensions can only be created by an already privileged user (or internally).

NOTE: While correct that validation is missing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place.
