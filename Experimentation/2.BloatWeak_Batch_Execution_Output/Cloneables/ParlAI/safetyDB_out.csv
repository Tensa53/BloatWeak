Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.

This vulnerability requires that the function 'IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title' be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on 'ctypes' in 'IPython.utils._process_win32' prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool 'set_term_title' could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. If an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. As a workaround, users should ensure that any calls to the 'IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title' function are done with trusted or filtered input.
