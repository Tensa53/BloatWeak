For example ‘setup_requires’ and ‘tests_require’ bypass pip --require-hashes. See also pypa/setuptools#1684.
It is recommended that you:
- Remove 'pytest-runner' from your setup_requires, preferably removing the setup_requires option.
- Remove 'pytest' and any other testing requirements from tests_require, preferably removing the tests_requires option.
- Select a tool to bootstrap and then run tests such as tox.
