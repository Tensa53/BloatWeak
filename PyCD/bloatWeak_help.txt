BloatWeak takes together many tools to find bloated dependencies and their related vulnerabilities
USAGE:
python3 bloatWeak.py <pro_path> <todir>
- pro_path: refers to the path for a Python project or a configuration file.
- todir: refers to a directory that stores all the output obtained from BloatWeak
OUTPUT:
The list of all bloated dependencies, the ones affected by vulnerabilities are highlighted with 'VULNERABLE!!!' message on the same line
All you can find in your directory are three files:
- pycd_out.csv: the ouput obtained from the PyCD tool with GetDep_ast.py script, it contains all the information about the dependency of the project analized
- requirements-unused.txt: the output obtained from fawltydeps and joined with the version column of the table stored in pycd_out.csv file, it contains all the bloated dependencies with the version
safety_out.json: the ouput obtained from the safety tool that had analized the requirements-unused.txt dependencies file, it contains all the information about the bloated dependencies and their related vulnerabilities
